This is a template function which makes it possible to branch on a collection of string literals in
an efficient way. By using `switch`, such branching is compiled to a trie of primitive parsing
operations, which has optimized control flow, vectorized reads and grouped checking for needed input
bytes.

The syntax is slightly magical, it overloads the usual @case@ expression. An example:

@
    $(switch [| case _ of
        "foo" -> pure True
        "bar" -> pure False |])
@

The underscore is mandatory in @case _ of@. Each branch must be a string literal, but optionally
we may have a default case, like in

@
    $(switch [| case _ of
        "foo" -> pure 10
        "bar" -> pure 20
        _     -> pure 30 |])
@

All case right hand sides must be parsers with the same type. That type is also the type
of the whole `switch` expression.

A `switch` has longest match semantics, and the order of cases does not matter, except for
the default case, which may only appear as the last case.

If a `switch` does not have a default case, and no case matches the input, then it returns with
failure, \without\ having consumed any input. A fallthrough to the default case also does not
consume any input.

switch :: Q Exp -> Q Exp
switch = switchWithPost Nothing

{-|
Switch expression with an optional first argument for performing a post-processing action after
every successful branch matching, not including the default branch. For example, if we have
@ws :: ParserT st e ()@ for a whitespace parser, we might want to consume whitespace after matching
on any of the switch cases. For that case, we can define a "lexeme" version of `switch` as
follows.

@
  switch' :: Q Exp -> Q Exp
  switch' = switchWithPost (Just [| ws |])
@

Note that this @switch'@ function cannot be used in the same module it's defined in, because of the
stage restriction of Template Haskell.
